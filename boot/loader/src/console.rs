//! Boot console: dual serial + framebuffer output.
//!
//! Provides `init_serial()`, `init_framebuffer()`, and `console_write_str()`
//! used by the `bprint!`/`bprintln!` macros. Output goes to both the serial
//! port and the framebuffer (when available). All state is static; the
//! bootloader is single-threaded and never runs concurrent code.

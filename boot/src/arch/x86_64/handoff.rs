//! Kernel handoff for x86-64.
//!
//! Provides the trampoline stub and `perform_handoff`, which installs the
//! initial PML4 page table via CR3 and transfers control to the kernel entry
//! point.

// Trampoline: a small position-independent stub in .text that executes
// across the CR3 switch. Under UEFI x86-64, VA == PA (1:1 mapping), so
// the symbol address is both the current VA and the physical address.
// We identity-map the page(s) containing the trampoline as RX in the new
// page tables so the CPU can fetch instructions after mov cr3.
//
// Parameter convention (caller loads before jmp):
//   rax = CR3 (physical PML4 base)
//   rbx = entry (kernel virtual entry point)
//   rcx = boot_info (physical address, identity-mapped)
//   rdx = stack_top (physical address, identity-mapped)
//
// The stub itself uses no memory, no RIP-relative references — fully
// position-independent by construction.

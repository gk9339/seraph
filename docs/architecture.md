# Architecture Overview

This document describes Seraph's component structure and the boundaries between
kernel mechanisms and userspace policy.

---

## Philosophy

Seraph is a microkernel‑based operating system. The kernel is a minimal, trusted
component that provides only core mechanisms: isolation, communication, scheduling,
memory management, and capability enforcement.

All policy and services live in userspace.

Expanding kernel scope increases the TCB and MUST be treated as an architectural
decision.

---

## Kernel Responsibilities

The kernel provides only the core mechanisms required to support the system.

The kernel is responsible for:

**IPC**
Message delivery between processes, including endpoint management and asynchronous
notifications. The kernel enforces that communication occurs only via authorised
capabilities and does not interpret message contents.

**Scheduling**
Preemptive, priority‑based scheduling across all CPUs. Userspace may freely alter
priority to some level; changes beyond a certain level require explicit authority
via capabilies.

**Memory management**
Physical frame allocation, virtual address space management, and page table
maintenance. The kernel enforces isolation between address spaces and explicit,
capability‑controlled sharing.

**Capabilities**
The sole access control mechanism. All resources—memory regions, IPC endpoints,
interrupt lines, and CPU time—are represented as capabilities and enforced
unconditionally by the kernel. See [capability-model.md](capability-model.md)
for the full model.

The kernel does not implement filesystems, device drivers, network stacks, user
management, or other policy. These components run in userspace.

---

## System Architecture

All inter-component communication crosses the kernel via IPC. There are no shared
memory shortcuts between services except where explicitly established as a
capability-granted shared mapping.

---

## Userspace Services

System functionality beyond core mechanisms is implemented in userspace as isolated
services and applications. All services communicate exclusively via IPC and operate
under explicit capability grants.

**init**
First userspace process. Starts procmgr, requests early services (devmgr, svcmgr,
drivers, vfsd), delegates capabilities, and exits. See [boot-protocol.md](boot-protocol.md).

**procmgr**
Process lifecycle manager. All post-boot process creation, ELF loading, and teardown
go through procmgr.

**svcmgr**
Service health monitor. Detects crashes and requests restarts via procmgr; holds
direct process-creation capabilities to restart procmgr itself.

**devmgr**
Device manager. Receives platform resource capabilities from init, enumerates devices,
spawns driver processes, and delegates per-device capabilities.
See [device-management.md](device-management.md).

**drivers**
Isolated userspace processes. Access hardware only through capabilities granted by
devmgr.

**vfsd**
Unified filesystem namespace over separate fs driver processes. Delegates operations
to the appropriate driver.

**fs drivers**
Separate binaries in `fs/` (FAT, ext4, tmpfs, etc.), launched by vfsd. Communicate
with block drivers via IPC.

**netd**
Network stack. Manages interfaces via driver IPC and exposes socket-like endpoints
to applications.

**logd**
Receives structured log messages via IPC and routes them to configured sinks.

**base**
Unprivileged applications (shell, terminal, editor, core tools).

## Kernel Primitives vs. Userspace Abstractions

The kernel manages three primitive object types:

- **Thread** — a schedulable unit of execution with a saved register state, a priority,
  and bindings to an AddressSpace, a CSpace, and an IPC buffer.
- **AddressSpace** — a virtual address space with a page table root and a set of
  frame mappings. Revoking an AddressSpace capability stops all threads bound to it.
- **CSpace** — a capability space: a growable array of capability slots that a thread
  uses to name kernel objects.

The kernel has no "Process" object. A **process** is a userspace convention: a group
of threads sharing an AddressSpace and a CSpace, managed by procmgr. The kernel
enforces isolation via AddressSpace and CSpace boundaries, not via a process abstraction.

## Bootstrap Sequence

```
Bootloader → kernel_entry
    → Phase 0–8: memory, paging, caps, scheduler init
    → Phase 9: map init from pre-parsed InitImage segments
    → Phase 9: scheduler handoff — init runs in userspace

init
    → start procmgr (built-in ELF parser + raw syscalls)
    → request: start devmgr, svcmgr, drivers, vfsd [, netd]
    → delegate capabilities to each service
    → exit

procmgr    — all subsequent process creation goes through here
devmgr     — platform enumeration, driver binding
drivers    — block, FS, [net], etc.
vfsd       — unified filesystem namespace
svcmgr     — service monitoring, restarts, procmgr fallback
[netd]     — network stack (optional early-boot module)
```

Boot modules (procmgr, devmgr, drivers, etc.) are configurable via `boot.conf`.
The bootloader loads the configured set from the ESP; init starts them in order.
The minimum set is: procmgr, devmgr, one block driver, one FS driver, vfsd.

## Driver Model

Device drivers run as unprivileged userspace processes. No driver code executes in
kernel space. Hardware access is granted explicitly via capabilities and is fully
revocable.

**MMIO**
Physical MMIO regions are mapped into a driver’s address space under capability
control. Once mapped, drivers access registers directly without kernel mediation.

**Port I/O (x86‑64 only)**
Drivers receive an IoPortRange capability for assigned port ranges. Binding this
capability enables direct execution of port I/O instructions for those ranges.
Access is revoked automatically when the capability is revoked. RISC‑V does not
support port I/O.

**DMA**
DMA access requires an explicit DMA capability. On platforms with an IOMMU, the
kernel programs the IOMMU to restrict DMA to authorised regions. On platforms
without an IOMMU, DMA isolation is not enforced; callers MUST explicitly acknowledge
this when granting DMA access. See `device-management.md`.

**Interrupts**
Hardware interrupts are received by the kernel and delivered to drivers as
asynchronous IPC notifications. Drivers re‑enable interrupt delivery explicitly
after handling.

---

## IPC (summary — [ipc-design.md](ipc-design.md))

All inter‑process communication occurs via the kernel’s IPC mechanism. Shared memory
is established only via explicit capability-granted mappings.

- **Synchronous calls** for structured request/reply between services.
- **Asynchronous notifications** for interrupts and completion signals.

---

## Memory Model (summary — [memory-model.md](memory-model.md))

Higher-half kernel layout on both architectures. Each process has an isolated address
space. The kernel enforces W^X at the page table level.

---

## Capability Model (summary — [capability-model.md](capability-model.md))

Capabilities are the sole access control mechanism. Every resource is represented by
a capability; threads MUST hold a valid capability to access any resource.

---

## Target Platforms

Seraph targets 64‑bit architectures with modern MMU and privilege support.

**x86‑64**
Uses APIC, PCIDs, IOMMU where available. 32-bit and legacy x86 are not supported.

**RISC‑V (RV64GC)**
RV64GC base ISA (IMAFD + compressed). Embedded or non-standard configurations are
not targeted.

See [coding-standards.md#architecture-specific-code](coding-standards.md#architecture-specific-code)
for the architectural code isolation rules.

---

## Non-Goals

**POSIX API compatibility.**
Seraph defines its own native interfaces. Filesystem formats and network protocols
may be adopted as data formats, not as API commitments.

**Binary compatibility with other operating systems.**
Seraph does not aim to run Linux or other OS binaries.

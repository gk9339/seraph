# Coding Standards

This document specifies the coding conventions and safety rules that apply to all
source code in the Seraph project.

---

## A. Tooling Invariants

### Formatters

The following tools are mandatory and authoritative. Each is configured at the repo root.

| Language | Tool | Config |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | `cargo fmt` | `rustfmt.toml` |
| C | `clang-format -i <file>` | `.clang-format` |

Formatters MUST be run before committing. Rules enforced by these tools are not
restated in this document. Developers MUST NOT disable or bypass these tools.

`.editorconfig` is authoritative for editor-level settings (indentation, line endings,
trailing whitespace). Editors MUST respect it.

### Clippy

Clippy defines the baseline for correct Rust code. The following lint groups are mandatory:

- `clippy::all`
- `clippy::pedantic`
- `clippy::cargo`

`cargo xtask build` runs Clippy with all warnings treated as errors. Code that does
not pass this configuration is non-compliant. Configuration lives in `[workspace.lints]`
in the root `Cargo.toml`; all member crates opt in via `[lints] workspace = true`.

### Markdown

Markdown source SHOULD be soft-wrapped to the project column limit (100 characters).
Paragraphs are separated by exactly one blank line.
Hard line breaks MUST NOT be used for visual layout only.

---

## B. Safety and Correctness Invariants

### File Headers

Every source file MUST open with a license block, a path line, and a brief description.
Author names and dates MUST NOT appear in file headers — version control handles that.

#### Structure

Elements appear in this order, each separated by a blank line:

1. **License block** — SPDX identifier, then copyright line(s)
2. **Path** — repository-relative path to this file
3. **Description** — brief summary of the file's purpose

For shell scripts with a shebang, the shebang MUST precede the license block on line 1.

#### License Block

```
SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only
Copyright (C) <year> <name> <email>
```

Comment syntax follows the file type: `//` for Rust and assembly, `#` for shell. Files
using block comments use the `/* * ... */` style throughout, headers included.

#### Description in Rust Files

Rust files MUST use `//!` inner doc comments for the description rather than plain
comments. These are the module's rustdoc entry. The first `//!` line is the short
summary shown in module index views; additional paragraphs, separated by a blank `//!`
line, appear only on the module's own page. Crate-level attributes (`#![no_std]`,
`#![cfg_attr(...)]`) follow the `//!` block.

#### Third-Party Attribution

Files derived from third-party sources list the original copyright first, with a note
identifying the source. Add your own copyright only for meaningful original contributions.

---

### Naming

#### General Rules (All Languages)

- `snake_case` for variables, functions, and modules
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants and macros
- Names SHOULD be self-describing. If a name requires a comment to explain what it refers
  to, rename it instead.
- Abbreviations SHOULD be used only when universally understood in context (`addr`, `buf`,
  `len`, `idx`). Avoid novel abbreviations.

#### Rust

| Item | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Variables, functions, methods | `snake_case` | `frame_count` |
| Modules | `snake_case` | `memory::paging` |
| Types (structs, enums, unions) | `PascalCase` | `PageTable` |
| Traits | `PascalCase` | `FrameAllocator` |
| Constants and statics | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_ORDER` |
| Enum variants | `PascalCase` | `Error::OutOfMemory` |

#### C

| Item | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Variables and functions | `snake_case` | `map_region` |
| Typedef'd structs and enums | `snake_case_t` | `process_t` |
| Macros and constants | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | `PAGE_SIZE` |

Struct and enum tags use plain `snake_case` without `_t`:

```c
typedef struct process
{
    pid_t pid;
    char* name;
} process_t;
```

#### Assembly

Follow the target architecture's register naming conventions. Labels use `snake_case`.
Global symbols are prefixed with the component name to avoid collisions
(e.g. `kernel_entry`, `boot_gdt`).

---

### Function Design

- Functions MUST do one thing. If a function needs a comment to separate phases, split it.
- Functions SHOULD be under 50 lines. Functions over 100 lines require strong justification.
- Boolean parameters that alter behaviour MUST NOT be used — prefer separate functions or
  an explicit enum.

---

### Error Handling

#### Rust

- All fallible operations MUST return `Result`. Callers MUST handle errors explicitly.
- `unwrap()` and `expect()` MUST NOT be used in production code paths. Permitted in tests
  and in `const` contexts where the value is statically guaranteed.
- `panic!` MUST NOT be used in production code. A kernel panic is a last resort for
  unrecoverable states only, not a substitute for error handling.
- Error types are defined per-subsystem and carry enough context for the caller to decide
  without inspecting internal state.

#### C

- Functions that can fail MUST return a status code or a sentinel error value. Error paths
  MUST be documented in the function comment.
- Return values from fallible functions MUST NOT be silently discarded. If intentionally
  ignored, document why.

---

### Assertions

Assertions communicate invariants — conditions that must hold for the program to be
correct. They are not error handling.

- `debug_assert!` / `assert()` in debug builds: use liberally for internal invariants.
  Removed in release builds.
- `assert!` / unconditional `assert()`: use only for invariants whose violation indicates
  an unrecoverable correctness failure. Remain in release builds; use sparingly.
- External values (user input, hardware registers, boot info) MUST NOT be asserted on.
  Return an error instead.

---

### Unsafe Code

- Unsafe blocks MUST be as small as possible — wrap only the lines that require it.
- Every unsafe block MUST be preceded by a `// SAFETY:` comment explaining why the
  operation is sound: what invariants hold, what has been checked, and why safe Rust
  cannot express it.
- Unsafe MUST NOT be used to work around a design problem — reconsider the design first.
- `unsafe fn` MUST document their safety contract under a `# Safety` rustdoc heading.

```rust
// SAFETY: `ptr` is non-null and correctly aligned, and we hold the exclusive
// lock on this region for the duration of this call.
let value = unsafe { ptr.read() };
```

---

### Memory Allocation

- All allocation paths MUST handle failure explicitly — no silent OOM.
- In the kernel, prefer static or pool allocation on hot paths. Document why dynamic
  allocation is acceptable at each site where it appears.
- Allocation MUST NOT occur inside interrupt handlers.

---

### Concurrency

- Shared mutable state MUST be protected by an explicit synchronisation primitive. Use
  `Mutex<T>` rather than a bare `T` with a separate lock — the type system should enforce
  the invariant.
- Prefer message passing over shared memory; shared memory is a deliberate optimisation,
  not the default.
- Lock ordering MUST be documented and consistent. When acquiring multiple locks, always
  take them in the documented order.
- A lock MUST NOT be held across an IPC call or any operation that may block.

---

### Documentation

- All public APIs MUST have rustdoc comments covering behaviour, arguments, return value,
  and all error variants.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. Self-evident code needs no comment; non-obvious
  logic must explain its reasoning.
- TODO comments MUST state what needs doing and why it was deferred.
- Architecture decisions not obvious from the code belong in the relevant `docs/` file,
  not only in inline comments.

---

## C. Architecture Invariants

- All architecture-specific behaviour MUST be behind a trait or module boundary.
  No `#[cfg(target_arch)]` blocks in architecture-neutral code.
- Inline assembly MUST be isolated to dedicated functions or modules; never inlined
  alongside logic.
- Every inline assembly block MUST comment what it does, what registers it clobbers,
  and what constraints it assumes.
- When adding a new architecture, do not diverge from the interface contract without
  updating both implementations.

---

## D. Testing Invariants

For kernel testing strategy and how to run tests, see [build-system.md](build-system.md#testing).

### Unit Tests

Unit tests live in a `#[cfg(test)]` module at the bottom of each source file:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests
{
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn alloc_fails_when_no_regions_added()
    {
        let mut alloc = BuddyAllocator::new(10);
        assert_eq!(alloc.alloc(0), None);
    }
}
```

Rules:
- Tests MUST have one logical assertion per test function.
- Test names read as a sentence describing expected behaviour.
- Tests MUST be independent and order-independent.
- Tests MUST be deterministic — no randomness, no timing, no external state.
- In test code, `assert!`, `assert_eq!`, `assert_ne!`, `unwrap()`, and `expect()` are
  all permitted.

### What Must Be Tested

- Every public function MUST have at least one success-path test and at least one test
  per failure mode.
- Boundary conditions: empty input, maximum-size input, off-by-one cases.
- Every `Result::Err` variant a function can return MUST be exercised.
- Modules containing `unsafe` blocks MUST have tests confirming the safe wrapper upholds
  its invariants under normal use.

### What Should Not Be Tested

- Private implementation details not visible through the public interface.
- Trivial getters and setters with no logic.
- Code generated by `#[derive]`, unless custom logic is attached.

---

## E. Exception Policy

Any suppression of compiler warnings, Clippy lints, static analysis checks, or
formatter behavior MUST:

- Be as narrowly scoped as possible (prefer item-level `#[allow(...)]` over
  module-level `#![allow(...)]`).
- Include a rationale comment immediately preceding the attribute, explaining why the
  rule is inapplicable at this site.

Blanket or module-wide suppressions are forbidden without explicit justification.

```rust
// `capacity` is part of the public contract on all target architectures; the
// field is unused on x86_64 but MUST NOT be removed.
#[allow(dead_code)]
capacity: usize,
```

---

## Build and CI

`cargo xtask build` is the single mandatory build command; it runs Clippy with the
mandated lint groups and treats all warnings as errors. Invocation details are in
[build-system.md](build-system.md).

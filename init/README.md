# init

Bootstrap service and first userspace process. The kernel starts init at the end
of its initialization sequence. Init is a minimal bootstrapper — it starts early
services, delegates all capabilities, and exits. It is not a long-lived service
manager.

---

## Role

Init's responsibilities are strictly bounded:

1. **Start procmgr** — init contains a minimal ELF parser (from `shared/elf`)
   and uses raw syscall wrappers (from `shared/syscall`) to create procmgr's
   process directly, without IPC. This is the only process init creates itself.

2. **Request early service startup** — init requests procmgr to start the
   remaining early services in order: devmgr, svcmgr, drivers, VFS, and
   optionally net.

3. **Delegate capabilities** — for each service, init derives and transfers the
   appropriate subset of its initial capabilities via IPC. Init retains derived
   intermediary copies (for potential revocation), not the roots.

4. **Register services with svcmgr** — before exiting, init registers all
   started services with svcmgr along with their restart policies and capability
   sets.

5. **Exit** — init calls `sys_thread_exit`. It holds no long-lived state, no
   supervision capability, and no restart authority. svcmgr takes over.

## What init does NOT do

- Does not supervise services or restart them on crash (svcmgr's responsibility)
- Does not hold raw process-creation fallback capabilities after delegating them
  to svcmgr
- Does not read a service dependency graph file at runtime (bootstrap order is
  compiled in)
- Does not remain resident after bootstrap completes

## Capability flow

At entry, init holds the full initial CSpace populated by the kernel:
- Thread, AddressSpace, and CSpace caps for itself
- Frame caps for all usable physical memory
- MMIO, IRQ, IoPortRange, IommuUnit, and PlatformTable caps from platform resources
- SchedControl cap
- Frame caps for boot module images (procmgr, devmgr, drivers, etc.)

Init derives and transfers these to services using the "derive twice" pattern
(see `docs/capability-model.md`) so it can revoke if needed before svcmgr takes over.

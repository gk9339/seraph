# Kernel Initialization Sequence

This document describes the kernel's initialization sequence from `kernel_entry()` to
the first userspace instruction of init. The sequence is divided into numbered phases,
each with a completion criterion and a defined failure mode.

Any phase failure is fatal; the kernel halts with a diagnostic message.

For the boot protocol contract (CPU state, BootInfo layout) that Phase 0 depends on,
see [docs/boot-protocol.md](../../docs/boot-protocol.md).

---

## Phase 0: Entry Validation

**Entry point:** `kernel_entry(boot_info: *const BootInfo)`

```
1. Verify boot_info pointer is non-null and naturally aligned for BootInfo
2. Read boot_info.version
3. Compare against BOOT_PROTOCOL_VERSION
4. If mismatch: halt immediately (cannot trust any other BootInfo fields)
5. Validate memory_map.count > 0 and memory_map.entries is non-null
6. Validate init_image.segment_count > 0 (init must have at least one segment)
7. Validate init_image.entry_point != 0
```

No output before step 1 succeeds; console is not yet available.

**Failure mode:** Infinite halt (`loop {}` / `wfi` loop). On x86-64, the halt
instruction is used in a loop to handle spurious wakeups.

**Completion criterion:** `boot_info` pointer is valid and `version` matches.

---

## Phase 1: Early Console

```
1. Call arch::current::EarlyConsole::init(&boot_info)
   - x86-64: checks boot_info.framebuffer.physical_base; if non-zero,
     initialises a simple pixel-writing framebuffer console;
     also attempts to initialise a COM1 serial port at 115200 8N1
   - RISC-V: uses SBI console (sbi_console_putchar) as fallback;
     framebuffer initialisation same as x86-64 if present
2. Emit a startup banner identifying the kernel and the protocol version
3. Emit: CPU architecture identifier and core count if detectable at this stage
```

The early console is allocation-free and output-only.

**Failure mode:** If no output device is found, initialisation continues silently.
This is not fatal — a headless system is valid.

**Completion criterion:** `arch::current::EarlyConsole::init()` has returned.

---

## Phase 2: Memory Map Parsing and Buddy Allocator

```
1. Iterate boot_info.memory_map.entries
2. For each entry with memory_type == MemoryType::Usable:
   a. Align start address up to PAGE_SIZE boundary
   b. Align end address down to PAGE_SIZE boundary
   c. Skip ranges smaller than PAGE_SIZE
   d. Add to candidate pool
3. Remove from the candidate pool:
   a. Frames containing the kernel image
      (boot_info.kernel_physical_base .. kernel_physical_base + kernel_size)
   b. Frames containing init segments
      (boot_info.init_image.segments[i].phys_addr + size for each i)
   bb. Frames containing boot modules
      (boot_info.modules.entries[i].physical_base + size for each i)
   c. Frames containing the BootInfo structure itself
   d. Frames containing the bootloader's page tables (if identifiable)
4. Determine buddy allocator order range:
   - Minimum order: 0 (one 4 KiB page)
   - Maximum order: implementation constant, e.g. 10 (1024 pages = 4 MiB)
5. Call mm::buddy::BuddyAllocator::new(max_order) — this is a static or
   early-heap allocation using only the bootloader-provided stack
6. For each candidate range, call BuddyAllocator::add_region(phys_start, phys_end)
7. Emit: total usable RAM in MiB
```

The buddy allocator MUST be initialized from a static buffer or boot stack, not
from itself.

**Memory at this point:** Only the buddy allocator metadata is allocated. No kernel
heap exists yet.

**Failure mode:** If total usable RAM is zero after exclusions, halt with message
"fatal: no usable physical memory". This indicates a corrupt memory map.

**Completion criterion:** `BuddyAllocator` is initialised and reports usable frames.

---

## Phase 3: Kernel Page Tables

```
1. Allocate a root page table frame via BuddyAllocator::alloc(order=0)
2. Zero the frame
3. Map the kernel image at its virtual addresses:
   - Text segment: readable, executable, not writable
   - Rodata segment: readable, not writable, not executable
   - Data/BSS segment: readable, writable, not executable
   (Segment addresses from ELF headers, sizes from BootInfo)
4. Map the direct physical map:
   - For each usable physical range: map at PHYSMAP_BASE + phys_addr
   - Use 2 MiB large pages where alignment permits
   - Use 1 GiB huge pages where alignment permits and range is large enough
   - Permissions: readable, writable, not executable
   PHYSMAP_BASE = 0xFFFF800000000000 (both architectures)
5. Map the BootInfo structure and boot modules (needed until they are consumed)
6. Install the new page table:
   arch::current::Paging::activate(&new_table, pcid=0)
   (PCID/ASID 0 is reserved for kernel-only contexts)
7. The bootloader page table is no longer referenced; its frames are not freed yet
   (they remain allocated but will be reclaimed after Phase 4)
8. Emit: "page tables established, physmap at 0xFFFF800000000000"
```

After this phase, the kernel can access any physical frame at `PHYSMAP_BASE + phys`.
All kernel pointers derived from physical addresses use this translation.

**Failure mode:** Frame allocation failure during page table construction is fatal.
Emit "fatal: cannot build kernel page tables (OOM)" and halt.

**Completion criterion:** The kernel is executing with its own page tables active.

---

## Phase 4: Slab Allocator and Kernel Heap

```
1. Initialise the general size-class allocator:
   - Bins at power-of-two sizes (exact range determined at implementation time)
   - Each bin backed by slab pages from the buddy allocator on demand
2. Register slab caches for core kernel objects:
   - CapabilitySlot (fixed size)
   - ThreadControlBlock (fixed size)
   - Endpoint (fixed size)
   - Signal (fixed size)
   - EventQueue header (fixed size; ring buffer body from size-class allocator)
   - WaitSet (fixed size)
   - AddressSpace (fixed size)
   - PageTableNode (fixed size; one per level-below-root page table frame)
3. Install the kernel allocator (implements the `GlobalAlloc` trait via the
   size-class path; used by any `alloc::*` usage in the kernel)
4. Reclaim bootloader page table frames (no longer needed)
5. Emit: "kernel heap active"
```

After this phase, `Box`, `Vec`, and other heap types work in kernel code.

**Failure mode:** If slab initialisation fails to allocate its first backing pages,
halt with "fatal: cannot initialise kernel heap".

**Completion criterion:** The kernel allocator is active and `alloc::boxed::Box`
allocations succeed.

---

## Phase 5: Architecture Hardware Initialisation

Architecture-specific hardware initialization; x86-64 and RISC-V diverge here.

### x86-64

```
1. Construct and install a permanent GDT:
   - Null descriptor (index 0)
   - Kernel code segment (64-bit, DPL 0)
   - Kernel data segment (DPL 0)
   - User data segment (DPL 3)
   - User code segment (64-bit, DPL 3)
   - TSS descriptor (per CPU)
2. For each CPU, construct a TSS:
   - RSP0: kernel stack pointer for privilege transitions
   - IST1..IST7: interrupt stack table entries (for NMI, double fault, etc.)
3. Construct and install the IDT:
   - Exception handlers for vectors 0–31 (divide error, page fault, etc.)
   - APIC timer vector (preemption)
   - Spurious interrupt vector
   - Syscall vector (though SYSCALL/SYSRET bypasses the IDT)
4. Enable SMEP and SMAP in CR4 if CPUID reports support
5. Configure SYSCALL/SYSRET:
   - Write kernel entry point to LSTAR MSR
   - Write segment selectors to STAR MSR
   - Write SFMASK to clear IF on entry
6. Initialise the local APIC on the BSP
7. Configure the APIC timer for preemption (period from scheduler policy)
8. Enable interrupts (STI)
```

### RISC-V

```
1. Write trap handler address to stvec (direct mode)
2. Configure sstatus:
   - Clear SIE (interrupts remain disabled until scheduler starts)
   - Clear SPP (so sret returns to U-mode by default)
   - Clear SUM (no supervisor access to user pages)
3. Enable SEIP, STIP in sie (external and timer interrupt enables)
4. Initialise PLIC for this hart: configure priorities and enables
5. Set SBI timer for initial tick (timer interrupt enable)
6. Enable interrupts (set sstatus.SIE)
```

**Failure mode:** Hardware initialisation failures (e.g. CPUID indicates a required
feature is absent) halt with a descriptive message. The specific required features
are checked against constants defined in `arch/x86_64/cpu.rs` and
`arch/riscv64/cpu.rs`.

**Completion criterion:** Interrupts are enabled, the preemption timer is running,
and the syscall entry mechanism is installed.

---

## Phase 6: Platform Resource Validation

Validates `platform_resources` entries before Phase 7 mints capabilities from them.

```
1. If platform_resources.count == 0: skip validation, proceed with empty set.
2. Verify platform_resources.entries is non-null (required when count > 0).
3. Verify the slice falls within boot-provided physical memory:
   - The entire range [entries, entries + count * size_of::<PlatformResource>())
     must be within regions the memory map marks as Usable or Loaded.
4. For each PlatformResource entry:
   a. Check resource_type is a known discriminant; skip with warning if not.
   b. For MmioRange, PciEcam, PlatformTable, IommuUnit:
      - Verify base is page-aligned; skip with warning if not.
      - Verify size > 0 and size is page-aligned; skip with warning if not.
      - Verify base + size does not wrap around; skip with warning if not.
   c. For IoPortRange (x86-64 only):
      - Verify base <= 0xFFFF; skip with warning if not.
      - Verify base + size <= 0x10000; skip with warning if not.
      - On RISC-V: skip all IoPortRange entries silently.
   d. For IrqLine:
      - Verify id is within the platform's interrupt number range; skip if not.
5. Check for overlapping MmioRange and PciEcam entries (overlaps within a type
   are invalid); skip the later entry with a warning.
6. Emit: "platform resources: N entries validated (M skipped)"
```

**Failure mode:** Null `entries` when `count > 0`: halt with "fatal: platform_resources
pointer is null with non-zero count". Individual bad entries: emit a warning and skip.

**Completion criterion:** The validated platform resource list is available to Phase 7.

---

## Phase 7: Capability System

```
1. Initialise the global derivation tree (initially empty)
2. Allocate the root CSpace:
   - Initial capacity: ROOT_CSPACE_INITIAL_SLOTS (e.g. 1024 slots)
   - Slot 0 is permanently null
3. Populate the root CSpace with initial capabilities:
   a. Frame capabilities for all usable physical memory ranges
      (one capability per contiguous usable region from the memory map)
   b. Capabilities from boot-provided platform resources (one per validated entry):
      - MmioRange entries → MmioRegion capabilities (Map rights)
      - IrqLine entries → Interrupt capabilities
      - PciEcam entries → MmioRegion capabilities (ECAM is an MMIO range)
      - PlatformTable entries → read-only Frame capabilities (Map rights only;
        no Write or Execute — these are firmware tables for userspace reading)
      - IoPortRange entries → IoPortRange capabilities (x86-64 only; Use rights)
      - IommuUnit entries → MmioRegion capabilities (for devmgr to configure DMA)
   c. One SchedControl capability (Elevate rights) — allows the holder to set
      thread priorities in the elevated range (21–30); delegated by init to
      services that require real-time-ish scheduling priority
   d. (Thread and process capabilities for init are added in Phase 9)
4. Record the root CSpace pointer in a global for use in Phase 9
5. Emit: "capability system initialised, N slots populated"
```

**Failure mode:** Allocation failure during CSpace construction halts with
"fatal: cannot initialise capability system".

**Completion criterion:** Root CSpace exists and contains capabilities for all
boot-provided hardware resources.

---

## Phase 8: Scheduler

```
1. Initialise per-CPU run queues:
   - NUM_PRIORITY_LEVELS priority queues per CPU (e.g. 32 levels)
   - Each queue is an intrusive doubly-linked list of TCBs
2. For each CPU (including the BSP):
   a. Allocate a kernel stack (KERNEL_STACK_SIZE pages from buddy allocator)
   b. Allocate and initialise an idle TCB:
      - Priority: IDLE_PRIORITY (lowest, reserved; never preempted)
      - Entry: arch::current::Context::new_state(idle_entry, stack_top, cpu_id, false)
      - Idle thread entry calls Cpu::halt_until_interrupt() in a loop,
        checking for pending work before each halt
   c. Set the per-CPU current_thread pointer to the idle TCB
3. Emit: "scheduler initialised, N CPUs"
```

**Failure mode:** Allocation failure for any idle stack or TCB halts with
"fatal: cannot initialise scheduler".

**Completion criterion:** Per-CPU scheduler state and idle threads are initialised
for all CPUs.

---

## Phase 9: Init Creation and Scheduler Entry

**Status: Implemented.**

Creates init's AddressSpace and Thread from `BootInfo.init_image` segments, then
calls `sched::enter()`.

```
1. Validate boot_info.init_image:
   a. Verify segment_count > 0
   b. Verify entry_point != 0
2. Create the init address space (AddressSpace::new_user):
   a. Allocate a new root page table frame from the buddy allocator
   b. Zero the frame
   c. Copy kernel PML4/Sv48 entries 256–511 from the active root so the kernel
      remains reachable from init's address space
3. Map init segments into the init address space:
   a. For each InitSegment in init_image.segments[0..segment_count]:
      - Align virt_addr and phys_addr to page boundaries before mapping
      - Map the page-aligned virtual address to the page-aligned physical frame
      - The in-page offset (virt_addr & 0xFFF) is preserved implicitly: the CPU
        adds it to the physical frame address at translation time
      - Apply permissions from segment.flags (Read → RO, ReadWrite → RW,
        ReadExecute → RX); W^X is enforced (ReadWrite cannot also be executable)
4. Allocate init's user stack (AddressSpace::map_stack):
   a. Allocate INIT_STACK_PAGES (4) frames from the buddy allocator
   b. Zero each frame
   c. Map below INIT_STACK_TOP (0x7FFF_FFFF_E000) with read/write permissions
   d. Guard page (unmapped) sits immediately below the stack; stack overflows fault
5. Create init's TCB:
   a. Allocate a kernel stack for init (KERNEL_STACK_PAGES = 4 pages = 16 KiB)
   b. new_state(entry=init_image.entry_point, stack_top=kstack_top, arg=0, is_user=true)
      stores entry_point in saved_state.rip (x86-64) or .ra (RISC-V)
   c. Priority: INIT_PRIORITY (15)
   d. cspace: set to ROOT_CSPACE raw pointer (handed off at `sched::enter()` start)
6. Enqueue the init TCB on the BSP's run queue at INIT_PRIORITY
7. Call sched::enter() — does not return:
   a. Dequeue the highest-priority ready thread (init)
   b. Build an initial user-mode TrapFrame on init's kernel stack:
      rip/sepc=entry_point, rsp/sp=INIT_STACK_TOP, cs=USER_CS, ss=USER_DS,
      rflags=0x202 (IF=1)
   c. x86-64: call switch_and_enter_user(root_phys, tf_ptr) — atomically
      switches RSP to init's kernel stack, writes CR3, builds iretq frame, iretq
   d. RISC-V: activate init's address space (satp write + sfence.vma),
      then return_to_user(tf_ptr) — restores registers and executes sret
```

**Implementation notes:**
- CSpace hand-off (step 5d): `sched::enter()` calls `set_current(init_tcb)` so `current_tcb()` returns the init TCB during init's syscalls; init receives ROOT_CSPACE.
- The x86-64 `switch_and_enter_user` function atomically switches the stack pointer
  BEFORE writing CR3. This is required because the boot stack is identity-mapped in
  PML4 entries 0–255 (the lower half), which are not copied into init's page tables.
  Any function call/return on the boot stack after the CR3 write would page-fault.
- Init segment frames are NOT reclaimed — they remain mapped in init's address space.

**Failure mode:** Allocation failure halts with a diagnostic message identifying the
failed step. Invalid init_image (zero segment_count or zero entry_point) halts with
"Phase 9: init image missing or has no entry point".

**Completion criterion:** Init is executing in user mode (ring-3 / U-mode).

## Fatal Boot Failure Handling

At any phase, if the kernel cannot continue:

```rust
fn fatal(msg: &str) -> !
{
    // Disable interrupts to prevent re-entrant failure handling.
    arch::current::Interrupts::disable();
    arch::current::EarlyConsole::write_str("KERNEL FATAL: ");
    arch::current::EarlyConsole::write_str(msg);
    arch::current::EarlyConsole::write_str("\n");
    loop
    {
        // Halt until the next interrupt (hlt on x86-64; wfi on RISC-V).
        // Interrupts are left disabled — this CPU is not taking further work.
        arch::current::Cpu::halt_until_interrupt();
    }
}
```

Secondary CPU failures after Phase 9 (user-mode entry) are handled by `fatal()` on
that CPU only; the BSP and other CPUs continue.

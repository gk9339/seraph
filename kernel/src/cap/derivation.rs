//! Global derivation tree lock.
//!
//! The derivation tree tracks parent/child relationships between capability
//! slots across all CSpaces. All mutations require the write lock; traversals
//! require the read lock.
//!
//! The lock is spin-based: sufficient for single-threaded boot and
//! forward-compatible with SMP — no changes to call sites when SMP is added.
//!
//! ## State encoding
//!
//! - `state == 0`: unlocked
//! - `0 < state < u32::MAX`: that many concurrent readers hold the lock
//! - `state == u32::MAX`: one writer holds the lock

//! Kernel early console: dual serial + framebuffer output.
//!
//! Provides `init()` and the `kprint!`/`kprintln!` macros. Output goes to both
//! the serial port and the framebuffer (when available). All state is static;
//! the kernel is single-threaded during early boot and never runs concurrent
//! code before SMP is initialized.
//!
//! Unlike the bootloader console, the kernel is a native ELF, so `core::fmt`
//! trait objects and vtable dispatch work on all architectures. The macros
//! accept full format arguments.

//! Event queue IPC — ordered, non-coalescing ring buffer.
//!
//! An event queue holds a fixed-capacity ring of `u64` payloads. Senders
//! append entries (non-blocking; `QueueFull` if full). A single receiver
//! dequeues in FIFO order, blocking if empty.
//!
//! # Capacity
//! The ring has `capacity + 1` slots internally (one-slot-gap full-detection).
//! The user-visible capacity is the value passed to `SYS_CAP_CREATE_EVENT_Q`.
//!
//! # Thread safety
//! All operations must be called with the scheduler lock held.
//!
//! # Adding features
//! - Multiple receivers: replace `waiter` with an intrusive TCB queue.
//! - Non-blocking recv: return `Err(WouldBlock)` when empty instead of blocking.

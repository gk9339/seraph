//! Signal IPC — bitmask-based async notification.
//!
//! A signal object holds a 64-bit bitmask. Senders OR bits into it;
//! a single waiter reads-and-clears the bitmask. If the waiter finds
//! zero bits set, it blocks until a sender delivers bits.
//!
//! # Blocking semantics
//! Only one thread may wait on a signal at a time (single-waiter invariant).
//! The waiter is woken immediately if bits are already set when it calls wait.
//!
//! # Thread safety
//! All fields are `#[cfg(not(test))]` to keep the struct out of host tests.
//! Access is serialised by the caller holding the relevant CSpace/scheduler
//! lock in kernel builds.
//!
//! # Adding multi-waiter support
//! Replace `waiter` with an intrusive queue of TCBs and wake all of them
//! on signal delivery.

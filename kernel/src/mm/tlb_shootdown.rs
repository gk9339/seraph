//! TLB shootdown protocol for cross-CPU page table invalidation.
//!
//! When a CPU modifies page tables (unmap, protect) for an address space
//! active on other CPUs, those CPUs must invalidate their cached TLB entries.
//! This module implements the synchronous shootdown protocol using IPIs.
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! 1. The initiating CPU stores the target address space root physical address
//!    in `TLB_SHOOTDOWN.root_phys`.
//! 2. It stores a bitmask of CPUs that must acknowledge in `pending_cpus`.
//! 3. It sends TLB shootdown IPIs to all target CPUs.
//! 4. Each target CPU receives the IPI, flushes its TLB, and clears its bit
//!    in `pending_cpus`.
//! 5. The initiating CPU spins until `pending_cpus` becomes zero.
//!
//! Only one shootdown can be in progress at a time (serialized by
//! `SHOOTDOWN_LOCK`).
//!
//! # Interrupt safety
//!
//! `shootdown()` temporarily enables interrupts during the spin-wait so that
//! target CPUs executing syscalls (with IF=0/SIE=0) can receive the IPI, and
//! so this CPU can service incoming shootdown IPIs from concurrent initiators.
//! Preemption is prevented by the caller via `preempt_disable()`.
//!
//! # Memory ordering
//!
//! - **Release** on `root_phys` and `pending_cpus` stores ensures remote CPUs
//!   see the correct root address before handling the IPI.
//! - **Acquire** on `pending_cpus` loads ensures the initiator sees all bit
//!   clears from remote CPUs.
//! - **Release** on remote CPU bit clears ensures TLB flush completes before
//!   the initiator proceeds.

//! Provides a ticket spinlock that disables interrupts on lock acquisition and
//! restores them on release, preventing timer-driven deadlock when the scheduler
//! lock is held.
//!
//! # Interface
//! Use `lock_raw` / `unlock_raw` exclusively. RAII guard support is intentionally
//! omitted: all current lock sites acquire the lock via `lock_raw` so that the
//! borrow of the containing struct ends before other fields are mutated inside the
//! critical section.
//!
//! # Adding new primitives
//! Place reader-writer locks, semaphores, etc. as additional `pub mod` entries
//! in this file.

//! RISC-V (RV64GC) MMIO ordering barriers.
//!
//! All three primitives emit a single `fence` instruction with no operands
//! beyond the predecessor/successor set. Inline assembly uses
//! `options(nostack, preserves_flags)` — the fence touches no registers and
//! has no stack side effects — but intentionally omits `nomem` so the
//! compiler continues to treat the barrier as having memory side effects and
//! does not reorder normal loads/stores across it.

/// RISC-V `fence w,o`: prior main-memory writes ordered before subsequent
/// I/O-region writes.
#[allow(clippy::inline_always)]
#[inline(always)]

    // SAFETY: the fence instruction has no operands and no register side
    // effects beyond the ordering it imposes; safe from any privilege level.

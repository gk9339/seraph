//! `x86_64` MMIO ordering barriers.
//!
//! All three primitives are no-ops. `x86_64` TSO orders all stores from one
//! core in program order, and the project's MMIO mappings (`SYS_MMIO_MAP`)
//! are strongly uncacheable (PCD|PWT), which further forces serialised
//! access to device registers. No explicit fence instruction is required at
//! any of the MMIO/DMA transitions this crate covers.

/// TSO + uncacheable MMIO already order prior memory writes before
/// subsequent MMIO writes; no explicit fence required.
#[allow(clippy::inline_always)]
